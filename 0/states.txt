We’re porting Ali’s JavaScript/HTML/CSS multitouch music app into C++ Combi Mode, which uses:

SDL2 → windowing & multitouch input

NanoVG (GL3 backend) → vector graphics UI

RtAudio → audio I/O

KissFFT → DSP/spectral analysis

CMake → build system

What’s done so far:

✅ SDL2 + OpenGL + NanoVG pipeline set up with fullscreen window.

✅ GLAD loads OpenGL.

✅ AudioEngine (RtAudio) runs at 400 Hz test tone.

✅ EventRouter handles events (SDL_KEYDOWN, SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN, SDL_FINGERDOWN, etc.).

✅ Touch logging: shows finger id, phase (start/move/end), normalized x/y, active touch count, and latency (std::chrono).

✅ Touch label: shows active touches in the window using Label class. Label supports font size, text color, background color, border color, and corner radius.

✅ Exit button: small red square at (10,10) quits app when clicked.

✅ Console logging cleaned: std::cout removed for keys, mouse, and touch logs (commented out). Only touch label and exit logic remain active. Frame latency logging is optional (commented in main.cpp).

Current state:

App runs fullscreen, displays window size and active touches as labels.

Terminal is clean (no spam unless we re-enable logs).

Multitouch is tracked, and label updates dynamically when fingers start/move/end.
