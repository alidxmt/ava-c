Transition from STK → DaisySP

MIT license, commercial safe

PolyBLEP oscillators, alias-free purity

Concert-ready sound quality

Optimized for real-time live play

Works with RtAudio I/O

Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS

Lightweight, embedded-synth proven

Superior to STK for waveform purity

Full DSP blocks: envelopes, filters, effects

Low-latency stability (64–128 buffer)

Soundpipe optional for FFT/harmonics

Drop-in replacement for STK oscillators

Easier integration vs raw PolyBLEP

Better than Chrome WebAudio potential

Supports harmonic periodic waveforms (with FFT add-on)

Future-proof design for scaling

Concert hall playable without reverb

Combi Mode++ foundation

Start on Windows → expand mobile
